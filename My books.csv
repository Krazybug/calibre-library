"Sloan, Joseph D","Joseph D Sloan","Over the years, thousands of tools have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks. They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them?*Network Troubleshooting Tools* does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of *ping* that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's *tkined* for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems.This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively.The topics covered in this book include:

  * Understanding your network
  * Connectivity testing
  * Evaluating the path between two network nodes
  * Tools for capturing packets
  * Tools for network discovery and mapping
  * Tools for working with SNMP
  * Performance monitoring
  * Testing application layer protocols
  * Software sources

If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.

### Amazon.com Review

Hooray for Joseph Sloan, who has written *Network Troubleshooting Tools*. Sloan's book catalogs--and evaluates, with intelligent and carefully researched commentary--scores of free utilities that have been developed for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting TCP/IP networks large and small. As such, it's a guide to the tools of the network administration trade. Without the concentrated wisdom that's found here, a network administrator might take years to stumble across all the fantastically useful utilities described in these pages, and waste all kinds of effort in the process. This book has found an excellent niche: a high-level technical book that earns its cover price by applying an author's experience and research to stuff that's freely available online, thus adding to readers' abilities to exploit the free stuff that's out there. 

The organization Sloan has chosen is interesting and efficient. Chapters deal with categories of utilities, such as packet sniffers and device mapping. Chapters begin with descriptions of the general purpose of utilities in their category and describe features (and alternate means of providing them) in general terms. Then come sections on utilities, complete with commentaries on the strengths of each and command-line dumps of the utilities in use. As utilities often are best used together, the author does a good job of showing what steps to take when that needs to be done. There's no companion CD-ROM, but the URLs that link to the utilities appear--sorted alphabetically by the programs' names, in an appendix. *--David Wall*

**Topics covered:** The free utilities--mostly for Unix variants--that the author has found to be most useful in his work as an administrator and troubleshooter of TCP/IP networks. Utilities for route tracing, packet sniffing, device detection, performance measurement, and other work are covered here. 

### About the Author

"Vandrunen, Thomas","Thomas Vandrunen","This book provides a distinct way to teach discrete mathematics. Since discrete mathematics is crucial for rigorous study in computer science, many texts include applications of mathematical topics to computer science or have selected topics of particular interest to computer science. This text fully integrates discrete mathematics with programming and other foundational ideas in computer science. In fact, this text serves not only the purpose of teaching discrete math. It is also an introduction to programming, although a non-traditional one. Functional programming is a paradigm in which the primary language construct is the function and function here is essentially the same as what it is in mathematics. In the functional paradigm we conceive the program as a collection of composed functions, as opposed to a sequence of instructions (in the imperative paradigm) or a set of interacting objects (in the object-oriented paradigm). Dominant computer science curricula emphasize object-oriented and imperative programming, but competence in all paradigms is important for serious programmers and functional programming in particular may be appropriate for many casual programmers, too. For our purposes, the concepts underlying functional programming are especially grounded in those of discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics and functional programming are equal partners in this endeavor, with the programming topics giving concrete applications and illustrations of the mathematical topics, and the mathematics providing the scaolding for explaining the programming concepts. The two work together in mutual illumination.

"Reitz, Kenneth","Kenneth Reitz","*The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python* takes the journeyman Pythonista to true expertise. More than any other language, Python was created with the philosophy of simplicity and parsimony. Now 25 years old, Python has become the primary or secondary language (after SQL) for many business users. With popularity comes diversity—and possibly dilution.

This guide, collaboratively written by over a hundred members of the Python community, describes best practices currently used by package and application developers. Unlike other books for this audience, *The Hitchhiker’s Guide* is light on reusable code and heavier on design philosophy, directing the reader to excellent sources that already exist.

"Robbins, Arnold","Arnold Robbins","As an open operating system, Unix can be improved on by anyone and everyone: individuals, companies, universities, and more. As a result, the very nature of Unix has been altered over the years by numerous extensions formulated in an assortment of versions. Today, Unix encompasses everything from Sun's Solaris to Apple's Mac OS X and more varieties of Linux than you can easily name.

The latest edition of this bestselling reference brings Unix into the 21st century. It's been reworked to keep current with the broader state of Unix in today's world and highlight the strengths of this operating system in all its various flavors.

Detailing all Unix commands and options, the informative guide provides generous descriptions and examples that put those commands in context. Here are some of the new features you'll find in *Unix in a Nutshell, Fourth Edition*:

  * Solaris 10, the latest version of the SVR4-based operating system, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X
  * Bash shell (along with the 1988 and 1993 versions of ksh)
  * tsch shell (instead of the original Berkeley csh)
  * Package management programs, used for program installation on popular GNU/Linux systems, Solaris and Mac OS X
  * GNU Emacs Version 21
  * Introduction to source code management systems
  * Concurrent versions system
  * Subversion version control system
  * GDB debugger

As Unix has progressed, certain commands that were once critical have fallen into disuse. To that end, the book has also dropped material that is no longer relevant, keeping it taut and current.

If you're a Unix user or programmer, you'll recognize the value of this complete, up-to-date Unix reference. With chapter overviews, specific examples, and detailed command.

"Crockford, Douglas","Douglas Crockford","Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.

"Burchard, Evan","Evan Burchard","Like it or not, JavaScript is not going away. No matter what framework or 'compiles-to-js' language or library you use, bugs and performance concerns will always be an issue if the underlying quality of your JavaScript is poor. Rewrites, including porting to the framework of the month, are terribly expensive and unpredictable. The bugs won't magically go away, and can happily reproduce themselves in a new context. To complicate things further, features will get dropped, at least temporarily. This book provides clear guidance on how best to avoid these pathological approaches to writing JavaScript. Bad code doesn’t have to stay that way. And making it better doesn’t have to be intimidating or unreasonably expensive.","/home/venus/Calibre Library/Evan Burchard/Refactoring JavaScript (62)/cover.jpg","2018-08-30T09:52:00-06:00","epub","","","eng","Calibre Library","2017-03-27T18:00:00-06:00","O'Reilly Media, Inc.","","","1.0","5428494","","Refactoring JavaScript","Refactoring JavaScript","62","1a8908fd-fcda-4765-9f43-1253eb77731d"

"Cameron, Debra & Rosenblatt, Bill","Debra Cameron & Bill Rosenblatt","GNU Emacs is the most popular and widespread of the Emacs family of editors. It is also the most powerful and flexible. Unlike all other text editors, GNU Emacs is a complete working environment--you can stay within Emacs all day without leaving. *Learning GNU Emacs*, 3rd Edition tells readers how to get started with the GNU Emacs editor. It is a thorough guide that will also ""grow"" with you: as you become more proficient, this book will help you learn how to use Emacs more effectively. It takes you from basic Emacs usage (simple text editing) to moderately complicated customization and programming.

The third edition of *Learning GNU Emacs* describes Emacs 21.3 from the ground up, including new user interface features such as an icon-based toolbar and an interactive interface to Emacs customization. A new chapter details how to install and run Emacs on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, including tips for using Emacs effectively on those platforms.

*Learning GNU Emacs*, third edition, covers:

  * How to edit files with Emacs 
  * Using the operating system shell through Emacs 
  * How to use multiple buffers, windows, and frames 
  * Customizing Emacs interactively and through startup files 
  * Writing macros to circumvent repetitious tasks 
  * Emacs as a programming environment for Java, C++, and Perl, among others 
  * Using Emacs as an integrated development environment (IDE) 
  * Integrating Emacs with CVS, Subversion and other change control systems for projects with multiple developers 
  * Writing HTML, XHTML, and XML with Emacs 
  * The basics of Emacs Lisp

The book is aimed at new Emacs users, whether or not they are programmers. Also useful for readers switching from other Emacs implementations to GNU Emacs.

Rivest & Clifford Stein","**The latest edition of the essential text and professional reference, with substantial new material on such topics as vEB trees, multithreaded algorithms, dynamic programming, and edge-based flow.**

Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. *Introduction to Algorithms* uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.

"Tong, Ka Iok","Ka Iok Tong","Agile Development, in particular, eXtreme Programming (XP), has been gaining a lot of momentum because it can effectively address the problems plaguing software development. In 2002, we, the Macau Productivity and Technology Center (CPTTM), started to hold courses on XP and OO design to teach the skills in agile development. At the beginning, we hired a well known software training and consulting company to teach. While the instructor was very professional and instructive and the feedbacks from the students were very good, the students didn't acquire the skills taught. We knew that it was because the concepts involved were abstract and it needed far more exercises for the students to practice in order to acquire the skills. Therefore, we decided to develop our enhanced training materials. In particular, we selected only 20% of the skills in agile development that deliver 80% of the value, while ignoring those useful but non-essential skills. Then we explained these skills in terms of examples and added a lot of real world examples as exercises. After adopting this set of materials, the new students really acquired the skills taught. Now we have organized the training materials into a book: Essential Skills for Agile Development. This book covers the essential skills in: OO design, Test Driven Development (TDD), team development, planning, communication and pair programming.

"Freire, Paulo","Paulo Freire","First published in Portuguese in 1968,* Pedagogy of the Oppressed* was translated and published in English in 1970. The methodology of the late Paulo Freire has helped to empower countless impoverished and illiterate people throughout the world. Freire's work has taken on especial urgency in the United States and Western Europe, where the creation of a permanent underclass among the underprivileged and minorities in cities and urban centers is increasingly accepted as the norm.

With a substantive new introduction on Freire's life and the remarkable impact of this book by writer and Freire confidant and authority Donaldo Macedo, this anniversary edition of Pedagogy of the Oppressed will inspire a new generation of educators, students, and general readers for years to come.

"Corbet, Jonathan & Rubini, Alessandro & Kroah-Hartman, Greg","Jonathan Corbet & Alessandro Rubini & Greg Kroah-Hartman","Device drivers literally drive everything you're interested in--disks, monitors, keyboards, modems--everything outside the computer chip and memory. And writing device drivers is one of the few areas of programming for the Linux operating system that calls for unique, Linux-specific knowledge. For years now, programmers have relied on the classic *Linux Device Drivers* from O'Reilly to master this critical subject. Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides all the information you'll need to write drivers for a wide range of devices.Over the years the book has helped countless programmers learn:

  * how to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system
  * how to develop and write software for new hardware under Linux
  * the basics of Linux operation even if they are not expecting to write a driver

The new edition of *Linux Device Drivers* is better than ever. The book covers all the significant changes to Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel, which simplifies many activities, and contains subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. Readers will find new chapters on important types of drivers not covered previously, such as consoles, USB drivers, and more.Best of all, you don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book. All you need is an understanding of the C programming language and some background in Unix system calls. And for maximum ease-of-use, the book uses full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware.Today Linux holds fast as the most rapidly growing segment of the computer market and continues to win over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas. With this increasing support, Linux is now absolutely mainstream, and viewed as a solid platform for embedded systems. If you're writing device drivers, you'll want this book. In fact, you'll wonder how drivers are ever written without it.
